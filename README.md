# odin-flex-test
Project for the end of the Flexbox chapter of the Foundations course of the Odin Project

Testing ability to create a responsive web layout using Flexbox.

A few solutions were a bit workaround-y, but I was trying to avoid using @media queried as we've not covered it yet and I wanted to practice using Flexbox specifically.
Turns out Flexbox is quite powerful! With a bit of wrapping the page is quite close to being properly responsive!
It did take a lot of divs in divs in divs though, which feels a bit ramshackle... But progress was made.
